In order to share learning and experience, I created a blog using <span style="color:#00bf5f">**Jekyll**</span> and **GitHub Pages**.
The theme currently applied to this blog is **Minimal Mistakes**.

More information about this blog can be found in the [`blog tag`](https://arduriz.github.io/tags/#blog/).
